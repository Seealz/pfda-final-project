    Title - Monsoo Rumble

    Repository - https://github.com/Seealz/pfda-final-project.git

    Description :

            * I'm envisioning a straightforward, turn-based RPG where the player faces off against a basic CPU opponent. The game kicks off with a title screen where the player selects their "Monsoo", while the CPU's "Monsoo" is randomly chosen. After that, the player and CPU battle it out in a turn-based format, and the goal is to defeat the  CPU and win. Each Monsoo will have unique designs and elements. 

    Features :

            * At least 10-13 diffrent "Monsoos"

            * Each Moonsoo has their own sprite in a 8 bit style similar Pokemon Red/Green 

            * Each Moonsoo will at least have one new move that does diffrent things, but generally all will have same basic attacks

            * CPU as opponent, will probably add a diffculty setting

            * I want to add visual elements to show a attack, like lightning for example

            * Finally I want to add basic Elements for each Monsoo, Like Basic, Fire, Wind, Water, Electric, Plant, ect.

    Challenges :

            * Adding sprites and limited animation

            * Implementing a element system

            * Adding multiple moves with different effects

            * Adding a basic CPU, and making it at least intellegent enough to make it difficult 

    Outcomes : 

            * My ideal outcome is a fully polished simple game with sprites, animation, elements, and implemented CPU somehow. I want it to at least be a fun little game, and even maybe add it so two players can fight. The Minimal outcome is I got to make unique sprites which is good to learn the 8 bit style and good to show off i can do pixel art, and being able to make a basic RPG which is good because my dream game is a RPG.

    Milestones :

            * Basic RPG System and placeholder sprites

            * Implemented elements and possible basic CPU

            * Polish game and make a menu to select Monsoo
