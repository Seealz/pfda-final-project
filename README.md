## Description

*Monsoon RPG is a simple, turn-based RPG game where the player battles a CPU-controlled opponent using unique creatures called "Monsoons." The game begins with a title screen where the player selects their Monsoon, while the CPU randomly chooses its own. The battle proceeds in a classic turn-based format, with each side taking turns to attack using a variety of moves. The goal is to defeat the opponent and emerge victorious.Each Monsoon is uniquely designed in an 8-bit pixel art style reminiscent of classic Game Boy titles like Pokémon Red/Green. There are 9 different Monsoons, each representing an elemental type such as Fire, Water, Electric, Plant, Wind, or Earth. These elements will affect gameplay, adding a layer of strategy based on strengths and weaknesses.

- **assets/** – Houses all images, animations, and sound effects used in the game.

## Outcome
Overall, I would say the outcome of this experience was successful. I’m proud of the work I was able to complete and feel that I delivered a solid game. Unfortunately, I was sick for about a week during themaking of this game,If I wasn't sick I believe I could have added even more stuff.
That said, I’m satisfied with the quality of what I did create, it is my first time making a game in python so i can't be to hard on myself. I’m confident that with more time and energy, I could take this work to a higher level.

### Future Improvements
Looking ahead, there are several areas for potential improvement:

- Add local multiplayer for player-vs-player battles.
- Improve CPU intelligence and difficulty scaling.
- Expand move sets to include status effects and abilities.
- Enhance visual effects for moves and attack animations.
- Fix Healing mechanic

## Milestones
- Built a basic RPG battle system with placeholder sprites.
- Implemented element types and a functioning CPU.
